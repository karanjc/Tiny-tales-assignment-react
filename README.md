This is the React assignment for the company TERRIBLY TINY TALES. 

In this, only 1 component App.js is there, all the code is included in this file. 

I've used modules such as papaparse, and chart.js.

On clicking on export button, it downloads a histogram.csv file and it shows the number of times each word is repeated.

After, it shows an error. So just click on the close button on top where error, is shown, and click on export button.
