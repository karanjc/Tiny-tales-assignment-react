This is the React assignment for the company TERRIBLY TINY TALES. 

In this, only 1 component App.js is there, all the code is included in this file. 

I've used modules such as papaparse, and chart.js.

On clicking on export button, it downloads a histogram.csv file and it shows the number of times each word is repeated.
